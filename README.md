# Simon Vedder 

**Hello people!**

It is a pleasure to meet you here. 

I am Simon, an IT professional with a passion for innovation and automation.
In my github repositories, I share my experiences and projects from the world of IT, cloud and DevOps.

## About Me
I was released in 1994 and after a couple of years of development, I executed "mv . /location/Germany/Hamburg"ðŸ˜œ

At first I started in Client Management, deployed software via SCCM and did a lot of PowerShell coding. Continued by stepping into cloud technologies with AWS and Azure. 
Due to the relationship with Microsoft - Azure was initially the choice.

I created a lot of automations and automated processes like 
- ordering process for AVD (RemoteApps & Personal VMs) based on own created ARM-templates, queue services and logging with log analytics & alerts
- automated tagging of resources
- deallocating compute resources for cost reduction (~50%)
- many more...

Later I got interested in other technologies and began to experiment with Docker & Kubernetes in my homelab. 
Here I am running multiple services, e.g. a reverse proxy, password manager, webserver and a coding environment.

Nowadays I work with AWS and Azure - side by side. Automate things with Ansible, run a server infrastructure with K8s and Docker and using CI/CD to deploy these.
